    "There are broadly speaking two categories of device used as light sources: *light-emitting diodes* (LEDs) and *laser diodes*. In general terms, LEDs are cheaper and easier to use, but have inferior performance compared to laser diodes.\n",

    "The output from an LED differs from that of a laser diode as it is possible to couple more light power from a laser diode than from an LED to an optical fibre, and the spectral linewidth of an LED is much broader than that of a laser diode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower power coupling from an LED comes partly from the fact that LEDs generally emit lower light power than laser diodes (the output from an LED is typically no more than −10 dBm), but also because the light from an LED spreads into a broader beam than the light from a laser diode. This latter point – the broader beam – means in particular that it is not possible to couple light from an LED very efficiently into a single-mode fibre, and in practice LEDs are only used with multimode fibre.\n",

    "*Single-mode laser diodes*, can have spectral widths of 10 MHz or less. Narrow spectral width is particularly important at high signalling rates and in dense wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) systems, so single-mode laser diodes are used in these systems.

Modulation of an LED by a digital signal is done by switching the electrical current supplying the device on and off. Laser diodes can be modulated in a similar way, but for operation at high rates it is better not to switch the laser off completely so that the modulation is strictly ASK (amplitude shift keying) rather than OOK (on-off keying).

    "The problem with modulating a laser diode by varying the electrical current supply (a technique known as *direct modulation*) is that the physics of laser diodes is such that the output wavelength varies with the electrical current. So as the electrical current is switched from high to low, and vice versa, the output wavelength also varies. This effect is called *chirp*, and results in an increase in the spectral width of the laser output. Chirp can be avoided by running the laser continuously at a constant high level (referred to as *continuous wave*, cw, operation), and modulating with a device that in some way attenuates the transmitted light under the (electrical) control of the modulating signal. This approach to modulation is described as *external modulation*. (Sometimes in practice the ‘external’ modulator might be physically integrated with the laser diode.) An additional advantage of external modulation is that it can allow the use of higher extinction ratios.\n",

    "A further refinement in the development of lasers in recent years is that it is now possible to buy *tuneable lasers*: lasers for which the wavelength can be varied under electrical control.

In graded-index fibre the higher-order modes are in glass with a lower refractive index when they are off the axis. Light travels faster where the refractive index is lower, so in the graded-index fibre the light travels faster in the modes with the longer paths.

    "The pulse spreading due to dispersion has the effect of limiting the bandwidth of single-mode fibre in a similar way to that in which multimode distortion limits the bandwidth of multimode fibre.

The ‘nm’ (nanometres) in this refers to the spectral width of the optical source and the ‘km’ (kilometres) the length of the fibre. The ‘ps’ is the time-spread in picoseconds.

    "The magnitude of dispersion in single-mode fibre varies with wavelength and in standard single-mode fibre (as specified by ITU-T G.652) the dispersion is lowest at frequencies in the 1300 nm window (it takes on the value of zero at some value in this window) and much higher (of the order of 20 ps nm<sup xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">−1</sup> km<sup xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\">1</sup>) in the 1550 nm window. When the frequencies in the 1300 nm window were used for long-distance communications (in the 1980s and early 1990s) this was very convenient, but with the advent of optical amplification by EDFAs (erbium-doped fibre amplifiers) the 1550nm window became increasingly important and the high dispersion at those wavelengths became a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of amplifiers, furthermore, at the same time as forcing a move to the higher-dispersion 1550 nm window, actually led to a demand for lower dispersion. Previously, before amplifiers were available, transmission links contained electrical regenerative repeaters. At appropriate intervals the signal was detected, converted to an electrical signal, regenerated, then converted back to an optical signal. Because of the regeneration, the signal transmitted on each repeater segment started off ‘perfect’, and in principle you could add more and more repeater sections indefinitely. (This is not quite true because regeneration is never perfect.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical amplifiers, however, amplify the signal without regenerating it. So if you replace the regenerative repeaters with EDFAs, the pulse spreading due to dispersion carries through the amplifiers, and for the link to work correctly you need to consider pulse spreading over the whole end-to-end link. Whereas previously dispersion only had to be low enough to prevent errors over the length of a repeater section, now it has to be low enough to prevent errors over the length of the whole end-to-end link.\n",

    "Instead of avoiding dispersion with low-dispersion fibre, it is possible instead to ‘undo’ dispersion through the use of *dispersion compensation* techniques.

Dispersion compensation is complicated to implement, but it allows existing fibre (standard single-mode fibre already installed) to be used with new systems. Furthermore, as will be seen later when we discuss fibre non-linearities, there are reasons why performance can be better over a system that uses dispersion compensation instead of zero-dispersion fibre."

In particular, when dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) is used on a fibre, four-wave mixing (FWM) can be a significant problem if the dispersion is very low. DWDM uses the 1550 nm window, so the requirement for higher dispersion to reduce FWM can be achieved by going back to using standard single-mode fibre. The problem of high dispersion then returns, but that can be overcome through the use of dispersion compensation.\n",

This is necessary to protect against abrasion, which can very easily damage the bare fibre. The polymer-coated fibre is then cabled to provide various degrees of protection depending upon the application. At one extreme the cabling could be just further plastic covering to produce a cable for use within a rack of equipment. At the other extreme many fibres could be put together in an armoured cable for use in a submarine optical-fibre link.\n"
