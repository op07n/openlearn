<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The building blocks of a basic optical-fibre communications link are the modulated light source, the fibre and the detector. There are choices to be made between different types of light source and fibre, with trade-offs between cost and performance. For example, for high signalling rates over long distances single-mode fibre will be used with a single-mode laser (possibly with external modulation) operating in the 1550 nm window, whereas for short-distance links operating at lower signalling
rates multimode fibre will be used with a directly modulated LED operating at around 850 nm.</p>
<p>The maximum transmission distance without regeneration at a given signalling rate over an optical-fibre link is limited by either attenuation or inter-symbol interference. The effects of attenuation are determined by calculating the power budget for the link. The main cause of inter-symbol interference in multimode fibre is multimode distortion, which is characterised by the bandwidth-distance product of the fibre. Causes of inter-symbol interference in single-mode fibre include dispersion and
polarization mode distortion.</p>
<p>Optical amplifiers can overcome the limits due to attenuation, and the effects of dispersion can be mitigated by using dispersion-shifted fibre or through the use of dispersion compensation. Increasing the capacity of a fibre through increased signalling rates becomes more difficult as the signalling rates rise above 40 Gbaud, however, and the alternative of using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is preferable.</p>
<p>WDM is usually done in the 1550 nm window because erbium-doped fibre amplifiers can then be used to amplify all channels simultaneously. Fibre non-linearities become important when dense WDM is used, leading to the need for non-zero dispersion-shifted fibre.</p>
<p>Beyond the simple point-to-point link, devices such as fibre splitters and combiners, WDM devices and optical switches allow more sophisticated use of optical-fibre communication, leading ultimately to the concept of an all-optical network.</p>
