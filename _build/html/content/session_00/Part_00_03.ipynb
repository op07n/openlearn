They use the same technology as the laser diodes that provide the light source at the transmitter, but have a different physical structure. Although SOAs have been available for some time and are potentially cheaper than EDFAs, their performance is not as attractive as EDFAs and they have not been very widely used.\n",

    "At the time of writing *Raman amplifiers* have just started to appear commercially. Raman amplifiers use *stimulated Raman scattering* (SRS) to transfer power from light at a pump wavelength to the signal. This effect is similar to what happens in an EDFA, but is caused by a different physical property leading to different characteristics. Whereas EDFAs transfer power from one or both of two specific pump wavelengths to a specific range of signal wavelengths, with SRS the importance lies in the difference between the pump wavelength and the signal wavelength. For both the 1300 and 1550 nm windows a pump at any wavelength will amplify light with a wavelength about 100 nm longer. Thus if you want to amplify light at, say, 1330 nm you need a pump with a wavelength of about 1230 nm. By having several pumps at different wavelengths, it is possible to amplify over a large range of signal wavelengths.\n",
